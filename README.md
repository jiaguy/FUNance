# Funance

Funance is a fun, interactive learning web-based game designed for young girls to learn all about personal finance. This equips them with the necessary financial literacy skills they need to save early and spend wisely.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to get started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
Installs all the required packages.

### `npm start`
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
